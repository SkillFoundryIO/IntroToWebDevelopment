# Block Elements Exercise

In this exercise, we would like you to try to write an employment cover letter organized using HTML block elements. The letter should have the format below, filling in your details for the [ ] items.

------

[Your Name] 
[Street Address] 
[City, St Zip]

[Today's Date]

[Name of Recipient] 
[Title] 
[Company] 
[Address] 
[City, St Zip]

Dear [Name of Recipient]: 

[Short introduction paragraph about yourself]

[List of skills and benefits you bring to an employer]

[Closing information, summary, or thank you as appropriate]

Sincerely,

[Your Name] 
[Title â€“ if applicable]

------

Consider organizing the content into semantic tags like \<main> in the letter. There are several "right" ways to accomplish this task; don't overthink it! This is just some light practice with block elements.
