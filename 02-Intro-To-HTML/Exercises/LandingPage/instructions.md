# Exercise: Web Developer News

#### Objective

Create a landing page for a Web Developer News website using HTML. This exercise will help you practice using different HTML elements, including semantic elements, and understand the difference between block and inline elements. The page will include a favicon, site information, article posts, and a registration form.

#### Requirements

- **Favicon:** Add a favicon to your page.
- **Site Information:** Use semantic HTML to structure the site's information section, including a header, main content area, and footer.
- **Article Posts:** Include at least three article summaries, each with a title, date, and summary. Use appropriate semantic tags.
- **Registration Form:** Create a form where users can register. The form should collect the user's first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and a bio. It should also include a checkbox for subscribing to a newsletter and a submit button.
- **About Us**: Also create an aboutus.html page and link to it from the main page. Put the link in an appropriate semantic element. Be sure to link back to the main page from the aboutus.html page.
